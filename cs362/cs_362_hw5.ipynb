If the second element is too small then we move the first tracker up one and repeat. If the second tracked element is bigger than the reciprocol we move our tracker down one and check again.

If it is in $H$ then we are done and we know its in there. If it is not in $H$ we add the original number into $H$. In this case we expect it to be $O(n)$ time."
