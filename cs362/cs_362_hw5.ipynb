We look at the first element and take its reciprocol, if the second tracked element is the same as the reciprocol then we are done. If the second element is too small then we move the first tracker up one and repeat. If the second tracked element is bigger than the reciprocol we move our tracker down one and check again. This is $O(n \\log n)$ because the sorting is $O(n \\log n)$ and the searching is $O(n)$."

We can start iterating through the list of numbers and for each number in the list we want to take its reciprocal and check to see if it is in $H$, and cheching to see if something is in a hash map we expect constant running time. If it is in $H$ then we are done and we know its in there. If it is not in $H$ we add the original number into $H$. In this case we expect it to be $O(n)$ time."
